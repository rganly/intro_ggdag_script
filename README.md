# Introduction to `ggdag`

This repository includes the script file associated with the [Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/)'s mini-workshop on [`ggdag`](https://ggdag.malco.io/index.html). 

### What you'll need to do

1. Access `code_intro_ggdag.R` within the `code` subfolder.

2. Run `renv::restore()` in R before going through the rest of the script!
